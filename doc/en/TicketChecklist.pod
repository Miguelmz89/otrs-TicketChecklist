=head1 NAME

TicketChecklist - Have a checklist for you todos with regard to the ticket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There can be several tasks mentioned in a ticket and when the ticket gets
more and more followups, it might be hard to remember what should be done
to solve the issue.

In that case a "TODO" list or a checklist would be helpful. As soon as
the ticket owner identifies a task that has to be done, that task can be
added to the checklist.

Such a checklist is provided by this addon. A new item in the ticket menu
appears: "Checklist".

As soon as a checklist for a ticket exists, you'll see a new widget in the
ticket zoom. Near by the ticket information the checklist is shown. 

You can see a few screenshots at
L<http://feature-addons.de/otrs/Ticket%20Zoom/TicketChecklist> (even though
a some screenshots there are for the pro version).
